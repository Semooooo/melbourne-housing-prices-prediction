# Business-Analytics

Dear user I hope that teh data I uploaded and shared will help you in your work to some extent.
For everyone familiar to some extent with machine learning (ML) and exploratory data analysis, any further
instructions are probably not necessary. However, for all those that are just stepping itno the ML fild,
I'm leaving some, hopefully useful instructions on how to use to code and data provided.

1) All datasets are stored in the "Data" folder...untouched data set and a cleaned one (it is a good to have both of the for comparison)
2) All plots generated for the purose of the project are stored in the "Plots" folder
3) Within each R script provided, the function and the purpose of each line of code is explained in detail.
   If something is missing however, pelase let me know.
4) Make sure to properly change the data path and navigate to the folder which you will use as your project folder.
5) Make sure to install all necessary libraries (in the code I have loaded more than necessary just because many of them are useful for later use)
6) I personally use R-Studio for coding with R, since I find it quite useful and user friendly especially for beginers.
7) Have a good time and let me know if you are facing some problems.
8) Cheers! d(^.^)b
